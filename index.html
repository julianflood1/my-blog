      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am new to Coding, and have enjoyed this journey so far! It has been a whirlwind of emotions for me, including anxiety and joy.</p>

    <h2>My Experience So Far</h2>
    <div class="post1">
      <h3>Week One</h3>
      <p>Week one was very exciting, yet challenging for me. I was new to coding, so everything I learned was new to me, and came with some new emotions. We learned basic HTML, CSS, and learned how to save and upload our progress with git and GitHub.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="post2">
      <h3>Week Two</h3>
      <p> Week two had new emotions associated with it. After overcoming the anxieties of week one, it has been a much more enjoyable and fun journey. We have learned about more complex techniques, such as more advanced CSS styling, creating GitHub branches, and much more!</p>

    <div class="post3">
      <h3>Week Three</h3>
      <p>Week three has been full of more thrills! we are now learning about divs and spans- which are a component of CSS, and make things much easier to style! Oh boy!</p>
